## User Experience

### Typography & Color Scheme

The project uses **DM Sans** for a clean, modern look with a simple, user-friendly feel. The color palette is primarily blue and white for clarity and readability:

- **Primary Color**: `#2142b2` (Deep Blue) üîµ
- **Secondary Color**: `#76a9fa` (Light Blue) üîµ
- **Background Color (Light Theme)**: `#f8f8f8` (Soft Off-White) ü§ç

This creates a calming and professional feel, ideal for a social media platform while being bright and easy on the eyes.

### Agile Planning

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This project was developed using agile methodologies over a span of approximately three weeks. The development process included the use of various labels such as "documentation," "good first issue," and "enhancement" to organize tasks and streamline progress. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone was established to focus on delivering essential features. Additionally, an "Enhancement" milestone was added to accommodate improvements and refinements throughout the project. Each user story is accompanied by a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria, ensuring that all functionalities are well defined and meet completion standards.

    </p>

  <h3><strong>Delete Post</strong></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Clicking the <strong>Delete</strong> option instantly removes the post from the platform and the user is redirected to the homepage.</li>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> The date when the user was blocked.</li>
    <li><strong>Unblock Button:</strong> A button to unblock the user, which removes them from the blocked list and restores their visibility in the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The <strong>Block User</strong> includes the following flow:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> Clicking the <strong>Block</strong> button sends a request to the backend to:
      <ul>
        <li>Store the blocked user's information (e.g., username, date blocked).</li>
        <li>Remove the follow relationship if the user was following the blocked profile.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Viewing Blocked Users:</strong> Users can navigate to <code>profiles/id/blocked-users</code> from their own profile to see a list of blocked users.</li>
    <li><strong>Unblocking:</strong> Clicking the <strong>Unblock</strong> button:
      <ul>
        <li>Removes the user from the blocked list.</li>
        <li>Restores the user's visibility in the app.</li>
        <li>The follow relationship is not automatically restored - users must manually follow the profile again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The backend manages the block/unblock functionality with endpoints for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Block User:</strong> Creates a block record in the database and removes the follow relationship if it exists.</li>
    <li><strong>Unblock User:</strong> Deletes the block record from the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Fetch Blocked Users:</strong> Retrieves the list of blocked users for the logged-in user.</li>
  </ul>

### Database Design

The database was designed to facilitate CRUD operations for registered users and maintain seamless functionality across various features.

---

Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles, which allows them to create and update personal information and profile pictures in the Profile table.

---

Posts enable users to create, view, and update their content, with relevant details such as title, content, and creation time stored in the Post table.

---

Users can also interact with posts through likes, comments, and reports, enhancing community engagement. Each like and comment is linked to specific posts and users.

---

Followers allow users to follow one another, creating relationships that support notifications, news feeds, and user interactions.

---

Notifications help users track various activities, such as new likes, comments, and posts from followed users.

---

Block allows users to block other users. The Block table stores information about the user initiating the block (blocker) and the user being blocked (blocked). This ensures that a blocked user cannot interact with the blocker. The Block table has a unique constraint to prevent duplicate block entries between the same pair of users.

---

Reports enable users to flag inappropriate content or behavior, linking the reporter and the reported user.

---

The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was designed on **[Mermaid.js](http://mermaid.js.org/#/)**.

---

### Tools Used

- **Git:** Used commands such as `git add`, `commit -m "message"`, and `push`.
- **Gitpod:** Used as the integrated development environment (IDE).
- **GitHub:** Used for code hosting.
- **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/):** Used for a variety of icons across the pages.
- **[Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/):** Used to generate the favicon.
- **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/):** Used to create wireframes (desktop version).
- **[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/):** Used to compress each image for optimal load times.
- **[Mermaid.js.org](http://mermaid.js.org/#/):** Used for generating the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

### Security

The application includes several measures to ensure data security and protect user information:

- **Authentication**: Secure user login with JWT tokens and email verification through Django Allauth.
- **Password Encryption**: All passwords are encrypted using Django's default hashing mechanism (PBKDF2).
- **Data Transmission**: All communication between the client and server is secured using HTTPS.
- **Input Validation**: Forms and API requests are validated to prevent malicious input (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Access Control**: Sensitive endpoints are protected with role-based access controls and permissions.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages are disabled to prevent exposure of sensitive information.
- **Secure Storage**: Uploaded files are stored securely using Cloudinary.
- **CORS Protection**: Configured CORS headers to restrict resource sharing to trusted domains.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Since the last testing phase, blocking/reporting/receiving notifications don't work as expected _access-tokens_ (14-01-2025). At this stage I cannot fix these issues, I'm sorry. It's on the upcoming patching issues.

## Testing

For an overview of both manual and automated testing processes, please refer to [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Dimitris112/La-Vie-pp5/blob/main/TESTING.md).

## Deployment

### via Heroku

1. Navigate to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) and create an account.
2. Click `Create new app`, enter the app name and choose your region, hit `create app`.
3. Click **Deploy** and in the _Deployment method_ option choose **Github**. Enter the repository's name and click connect, you can leave the branch deployment to `main`.
   > You need to have created your github repository.
4. Head to **Settings** and click `Reveal config vars`
5. On the KEY inputs add: ALLOWED_HOST - CLIENT_ORIGIN - CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV - CLOUDINARY_URL - DATABASE_URL - SECRET_KEY. On the VALUE inputs add your own, for each one.
   > CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV only if you make it into 2 individual repositories.
6. Click **Add buildpack** and choose `python`.
7. Now you're set. Go back to `Deploy` and click **Deploy branch**.

8. **_FRONTEND DISCLAIMER_** to have in mind. In order for your project to be up to date, you need to run a specific command in order to collect staticfiles. You will need to re-run this command any time you want to deploy changes to the static files in your project, including the React code.
   > npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.

</div>

### Via Forking

Forking a repository is commonly done to contribute to another developer's project or to use it as the foundation for your own. To fork a repository:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can modify independently.
