  A feature that enables users to block individuals they do not wish to interact with, fostering a safer environment.

- **Reporting Users and Posts**:  
  Users can report inappropriate behavior or content to ensure a respectful community.

- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**:  
  A customizable user interface with the ability to switch between light and dark themes for personalized comfort.

  Users can manage their profiles, including uploading profile images stored securely using Cloudinary.

- **API Integration**:  
  Backend API endpoints provide efficient handling of user interactions, post creation, notifications, and reporting.

- **Media Management**:  
  Integration with Cloudinary allows efficient upload, storage, and management of images within the platform.

## User Experience

### Typography & Color Scheme

The project uses **DM Sans** for a clean, modern look with a simple, user-friendly feel. The color palette is primarily blue and white for clarity and readability:

- **Primary Color**: `#2142b2` (Deep Blue) üîµ
- **Secondary Color**: `#76a9fa` (Light Blue) üîµ
- **Background Color (Light Theme)**: `#f8f8f8` (Soft Off-White) ü§ç

This creates a calming and professional feel, ideal for a social media platform while being bright and easy on the eyes.

### Agile Planning

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This project was developed using agile methodologies over a span of approximately three weeks. The development process included the use of various labels such as "documentation," "good first issue," and "enhancement" to organize tasks and streamline progress. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone was established to focus on delivering essential features. Additionally, an "Enhancement" milestone was added to accommodate improvements and refinements throughout the project. Each user story is accompanied by a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria, ensuring that all functionalities are well defined and meet completion standards.

Next to the logo is the <strong>Add Post</strong> button, which directs users to the <em>create post</em> page where they can share content.
      </p>
  <p>
      Users can see a <strong>search posts bar</strong> that allows them to search for posts or authors by typing letters. This search functionality displays matching results in real-time refreshed every second.
  </p>
  <p>
       Also, the right side of the screen showcases a list of the <strong>most followed profiles</strong>, and users can follow or unfollow profiles directly from this section.

        Next, users are prompted to enter the <strong>Title</strong> of their post and provide <strong>Content</strong> for the post description.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom of the page, users have the option to click on either a <strong>Cancel</strong> or a <strong>Create</strong> button. The <strong>Create</strong> button will remain disabled until the user has filled out all required fields: image, title, and content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the post is created, the user is redirected to the post's dedicated page where they can view or add comments. If no comments have been made yet, a message will appear: <strong>"No comments yet! Be the first one to comment!"</strong>

### Database design

The database was designed to allow CRUD functionality to registered users.

- Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles, allowing for the creation and updating of personal information and images in the `user_profiles` table.
- Reservations enable users to create, view, and modify their bookings, with relevant details like name, reservation time, special requests, and guest count stored in the `reservations` table.
- The Testimonials table allows users to submit their experiences, read others' testimonials, and update or delete their submissions as needed. It includes ratings and counters for views and comments to enhance community interaction.
- Comments associated with testimonials allow users to provide feedback, with the ability to add, edit, or delete their comments.

The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was designed on [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d)

## Testing

For a detailed overview of both manual and automated testing processes, please refer to [TESTING.md](https://github.com/Dimitris112/rum-away-testp4/blob/main/TESTING.md). It covers all testing scenarios and methodologies used in the project.

## Deployment

### via Heroku

1. Navigate to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) and create an account.
2. Click `Create new app`, enter the app name and choose your region, hit `create app`.
3. Click **Deploy** and in the _Deployment method_ option choose **Github**. Enter the repository's name and click connect, you can leave the branch deployment to `main`.
   > You need to have created your github repository.
4. Head to **Settings** and click `Reveal config vars`
5. On the KEY inputs add: DATABASE_URL - SECRET_KEY - CLOUDINARY_URL. On the VALUE inputs add your own, for each one.
6. Click **Add buildpack** and choose `python`.
7. Now you're set. Go back to `Deploy` and click **Deploy branch**.

### Via Forking

Forking a repository is commonly done to contribute to another developer's project or to use it as the foundation for your own. To fork a repository:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can modify independently.
