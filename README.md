## User Experience

### Typography & Color Scheme

The project uses **DM Sans** for a clean, modern look with a simple, user-friendly feel. The color palette is primarily blue and white for clarity and readability:

- **Primary Color**: `#2142b2` (Deep Blue) üîµ
- **Secondary Color**: `#76a9fa` (Light Blue) üîµ
- **Background Color (Light Theme)**: `#f8f8f8` (Soft Off-White) ü§ç

This creates a calming and professional feel, ideal for a social media platform while being bright and easy on the eyes.

### Agile Planning

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

This project was developed using agile methodologies over a span of approximately three weeks. The development process included the use of various labels such as "documentation," "good first issue," and "enhancement" to organize tasks and streamline progress. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone was established to focus on delivering essential features. Additionally, an "Enhancement" milestone was added to accommodate improvements and refinements throughout the project. Each user story is accompanied by a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria, ensuring that all functionalities are well defined and meet completion standards.
